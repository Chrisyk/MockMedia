# MockMedia

MockMedia is a three-tier web application leveraging React, Django, and MySQL. It ultilizes AWS micro-services, such as Amazon Relational Database, Amazon Simple Notification Service, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Simple Storage Service to provide a completely decoupled architecture. The communication protocol (ASGI) provides real-time communication between servers, allowing features such as real-time notifications and messaging. Both servers are hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud which makes communication extremely fast and secure.
