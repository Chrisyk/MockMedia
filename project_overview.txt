A social media app, should have three key features:

- Login/Register page ✅
- Home page ✅
- Account page ✅

Everything else is derived from these three

Some basic models I want in my app are:

- Follow System ✅
- Post System : each post has its own url : contains comments ✅
- Messaging System (one user could have one chatbox. One chatbox can contain multiple users)
- Notification System

Some features I want to include:

- Recommendation System
- Search funtion 
- Following only tab
- Comments and likes ✅

Important to do:

- Security
- Testing: Writing unit integration tests
